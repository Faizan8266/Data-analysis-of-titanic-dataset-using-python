 # Data-analysis-of-titanic-dataset-using-python

  In this project I have done data analysis of titanic dataset using python.
  Data of many passengers,both those who survived and those who did not compiled over the years
  and recently published,answering questions through data analysis.
  The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to programmatic data analysis concepts, by analysing the factors 
  that determined whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or did not.  Libraries.
  The Titanic Data as provided by kaggale.
 # Purpose of project
  The project makes heavy use of NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,and Data Visualization libraries.

 # Details 
  In the analysis of the Titanic dataset, the major question that arises is How many factors affected a person's survival rate? 
  With the given data, this question was broken down into further branches. 

 # Effect of age on survival rate?
 50.7% of the children from the data set survived while 38.1% of adults survived,resulting in children 
 being 1.3 times more likely to survive.
 
 # Effect of gender on survival rate - conclusion
It appers on average, women were more than 3 times likely to survive than men.
Due to binary nature of the 'survived' field type we can conclude that 75.3% of the women from the data set survived while only 20.5% of  the men survived.
